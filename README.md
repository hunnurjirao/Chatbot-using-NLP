# Create your Own Chatbot using NLP

A chatbot is one of the most important applications of Natural Language Processing. A good definition of a chatbot is that it is a software program that processes and mimics human conversation (either written or spoken) and that allows humans to interact with them as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be very simplistic or they can be very sophisticated.
